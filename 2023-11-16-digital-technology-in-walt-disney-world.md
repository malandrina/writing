# Is that a real alligator? Digital technology in Disney World

Lake Apopka is Florida's fourth-largest lake. A map from 1967 describes the surrounding area as _marsh_, _swamp_, and _longleaf pine forest_. Once a popular fishing spot teeming with wildlife, the lake's ecosystem was heavily damaged by chemical pollution and subsequently designated as a Superfund cleanup site in 1981. Efforts to contain and reverse the negative impacts to the aquifer are ongoing.

Fifty kilometers south of Lake Apopka, The Walt Disney World Resort spans 100 square kilometers, nearly the size of the city of San Francisco. Disney World's Magic Kingdom, with its iconic castle modeled on Schloss Neuschwanstein in Bavaria -- also a short distance from a lake, though not a heavily polluted one -- hosted 17 million visitors in 2022. It is the most visited theme park in the world.

Disney World employees are called _cast members_. At the entrance to Magic Kingdom a cast member will verify that you have purchased a ticket for the current day. You can do this by enabling near-field communication (NFC) on your smart phone and touching your phone to a Mickey-Mouse-emblazoned reader. Alternatively, you can show the cast member your ticket, digital or paper, so they can scan the ticket's barcode to validate its authenticity, after which you will be issued a plastic card with a barcode on it. Then you will be asked to place your thumb on the finger print reader. Once your thumbprint has been scanned successfully, you will be asked to touch your card to the reader.

The cast member assisting you may or may not be able to explain Disney's data retention policy. When you look it up later, you will learn that a unique identifier is generated from your encrypted thumbprint and associated with information encoded in your ticket's barcode. You have yielded up your biometric data to help The Walt Disney World Company maintain control over ticket prices: They want to make sure park-goers don't take advantage of the reduced ticket price that accompanies multi-day packages, use some of them, and then sell the rest at a discount to someone else.

As you make your way from Main Street to Fantasyland your small daughter spots the Prince Charming Regal Carousel. You glance at the numbers on the electronic sign near the entrance to each attraction: one shows the estimated wait time in minutes, typically ranging from 5 to 120, the other indicates whether the attraction has a second queue for park-goers who paid extra to opt into a system guaranteeing access to the attraction at a specific time.

The wait time is 15 minutes. You go for it. She is delighted to choose the most beautiful horse and soothed by the cool breeze against her skin as the carousel goes around and around.

After a lunch of plant-based bratwurst and tater tots at a Robin-Hood-themed food stall you use the Disney World app on your smart phone to check wait times. You see that the wait time to meet Mickey Mouse is short. Even better, the venue is indoors, which will give you a break from the heat. You corral your children and relatives into the queue demarcated by black velveteen rope and shuffle forward intermittently. Finally, the moment arrives: it's your turn with Mickey.

As your children and nieces and nephews crowd around Mickey, shy but thrilled, you are instructed to tap your card to a reader to ensure that the photos for this session will be associated with your account. The bright light flashing at a programmed interval is a camera flash. Your group arranges itself around Mickey and looks questioningly at the cast member at the front of the room for a cue as to where the camera lens might be. You figure it out and wait, smiling gamely but a little uncertainly, unsure when the photo will be taken.

Your children are overheating and tired of standing in queues. You decide to take the ferry to Tom Sawyer's Island in Frontierland and do some exploring. "Is that real?" they keep asking. The white ibis: real. The horse: animatronic. The threat of snakes: real. The hen: animatronic. The beautyberry, the poinsettia, the palm trees: real.

"Look! Alligators!" they shriek later when we pass some animatronic alligators during our ride on the Walt Disney World Railroad.

After two days in the Magic Kingdom theme park you are ready for a change. There are fewer children at Epcot and fewer child-centered activities. Two attractions offer contrasting experiences of narrative:

Spaceship Earth: the flagship Epcot attraction. You get in a small train on a track which takes you through human-sized tableaux of important moments in the history of humanity, which in this telling is a history of communications technology. From BCE until the 20th century, large bearded humanoids wearing loincloths and later pants invented new technologies like language, writing, and computers. In the 20th century, non-bearded humanoids wearing skirts appeared and joined the bearded figures in their work.

Journey of Water is "an outdoor exploration trail where water comes to life". Park-goers walk along a path and interact with water features through gesture. Your son runs his hand through a series of vertical streams of water and hears a series of notes played in response. A waterfall parts for you to walk through. Waves crashing against rock can be made bigger and more powerful by raising your arms above your head. You recognize the soaring crescendo of the background music from Disney's _Moana_. Everyone is calm and happy.

You wonder, briefly, what it would be like to interact with your home irrigation system by gesture.
